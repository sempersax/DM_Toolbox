The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn\u2019t affected. While in this form, the target\u2019s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can\u2019t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can\u2019t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can\u2019t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can\u2019t attack or cast spells.",
