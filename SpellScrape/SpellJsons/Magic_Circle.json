    "spellEffect": "You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: \u2022 The creature can\u2019t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. \n\u2022 The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. \n\u2022 Targets within the cylinder can\u2019t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.",
