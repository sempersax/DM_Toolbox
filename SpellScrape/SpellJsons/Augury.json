The DM chooses from the following possible omens: \u2022 Weal, for good results \n\u2022 Woe, for bad results \n\u2022 Weal and woe, for both good and bad results \n\u2022 Nothing, for results that aren\u2019t especially good or bad The spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.",
