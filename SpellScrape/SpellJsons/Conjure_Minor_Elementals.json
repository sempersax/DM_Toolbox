You choose one the following options for what appears: \u2022 One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower \n\u2022 Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower \n\u2022 Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower \n\u2022 Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower An elemental summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.  When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.",
