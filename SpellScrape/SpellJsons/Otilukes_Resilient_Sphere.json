On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothing \u2013\u00a0not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects \u2013 can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can\u2019t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere\u2019s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature\u2019s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.",
