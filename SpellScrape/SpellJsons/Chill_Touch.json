On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can\u2019t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.  This spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).",
