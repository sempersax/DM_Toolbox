The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere\u2019s area is difficult terrain. When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.",
