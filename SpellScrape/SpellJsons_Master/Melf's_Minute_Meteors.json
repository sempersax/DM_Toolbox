When you cast the spell \u2014 and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter \u2014 you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.",
