You affect it in one of the following ways: \u2022 You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location. \u2022 You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube. \u2022 You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour. \u2022 You cause simple shapes\u2014such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location\u2014to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",
