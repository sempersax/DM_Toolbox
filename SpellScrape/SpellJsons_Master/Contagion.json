At the end of each of the poisoned target\u2019s turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell\u2019s duration. Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease\u2019s effects apply to it.",
