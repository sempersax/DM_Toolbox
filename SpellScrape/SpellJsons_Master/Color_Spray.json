Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can\u2019t see). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract each creature\u2019s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the creature to be affected.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.",
